## Graphic Editor 2D and 3D

This graphical editor was created with the Java language using the swing library. The swing library is an official library included in any JRE or JDK, the Swing library is in the javax.swing package (integer except for the accessibility part, which is in javax.accessibility). Its main objective is to create and manipulate geometric objects in both 2D and 3D mode

## Main features of the program:

► Graphical drawing area (viewport) with coordinates of the world and that shows in perspective the defined scenario (when in 3d mode);<br />
► Defining and adding geometries (both 2d and 3d);<br />
► Functionality to define and apply transformations (rotation, translation and<br />
► Scale) in the created geometries (in both 2d and 3d);<br />
► Functionality of adding 3D objects by reading the file coordinates of predefined points;<br />
► Functionality of animating objects (in both 2d and 3d);<br />
► Zoom option through mouse button scrool;<br />

<!---## Motivation

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
